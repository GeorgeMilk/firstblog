		<p>The society man dreams of is racist in nature. One cannot imagine peace, prosperity, safety and fun all happening at the same time in the same society without removing certain individuals from said society. Political parties have electoral programs that would - perhaps - work in the perfect world. Allas, they also defend the systems responsible for destroying any hope of ever achieving the same perfect world of their dreams. The man of the left is the embodiment of cuckoldery because he knows what he wants, he sees what he wants, he is able to get what he wants, </p><p class="spoiler"><span class="spoiler-text">but he'd rather have the black man come and fuck it.</span></p>
